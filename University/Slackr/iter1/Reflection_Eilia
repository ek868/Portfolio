Strengths - I completed fairly extensive function tests in due time for all assigned functions. I also merged with branch
without any conflicts. I completed all of the User Stories for my relevant functions and features without much trouble.
Improvements - I could reduce the amount of stress on myself and my teammates by beggining work earlier and having more time
to make improvements and take advice. I could also make a greater effort in holding team meetings and communicating to reduce
the amount of confusion and increasing team efficiency.
