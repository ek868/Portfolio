In the upcoming iteration the team is about to implement the functions for the project, thereby, also using the test functions developed during the first iteration. 

The following points represent a deep through representation of our plan in the second iteration: 

- Call a meeting with the firm's HR department to take care of internal problems which raised during the first iteration.

- Review the clients's adjustments and new demand
- Review Sally's and Bob's new additions to the front end of the project

- Readjust the user stories if needed
- Readjust the test function if needed

- The last two points will result in an increase of workload, therefore, adding up extra duties for the second iteration. 

- Code review made by developers will be done every 5d,

- Call a meeting to organise the upcoming one week of work, and set up a plan to follow up with a linear reduction of workload over time. This will allow the team to maintain a constant speed through out the iteration. 

- Organise a 15min standup on sunday 13th October to discuss the progress of the project, internal affairs, and iteration speed. 

- Organise a 15min standup on sunday 20th October to discuss the progress of the project, internal affairs, and iteration speed. 

- Organise a 15min standup on sunday 25th October to finalise the product and review the code.


The team deemed to be happy with the tools used in the first iteration.
