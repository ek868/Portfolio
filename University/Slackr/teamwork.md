Hurdles we faced as a team:

- Various health issues within the team that slowed and sometimes prevented progress on the project (eg, sleeping disorders, black mold poisoning etc...)
- Misinterpretation of the project specs and misunderstanding of each others assumptions.
- Initially convoluted and inadequate data structures slowing down progress.
- having to re do all work in the assignment after re-working our data structure and revisiting our assumptions
- frontend release forcing us to change our assumptions yet again, also invalidating many of our tests.

How we dealt with the above hurdles:

- The health issues were perhaps the hardest to deal with, they did end up prohibiting work over some period of time but through dedication (and medication)
we got as much done as possible.
- Through the agile principle, we minimized the effect the change in data structures had on our progress. We used Trello task board to make it clear when
a function needed more attention, we used standups and team meetings to figure out the new specs and data structures, we used pair programming
to make sure that we were all on board with the new pattern of writing functions and the new data structures.
- We used similar methods to deal with the release of the front end.



Team meetings:

We met 2-3 times a week in the ainsworth consultation rooms, with the team members attending whenever possible. During the meetings, we used whiteboards,
Trello and pen and paper to visualize the data structures and allocated work to each team member. The frequent number of meetings and the in depth nature
of them was necessary because of the various challenges we faced forcing us to complete the project in a very time intensive situation. Thus, communication
was required to fascilitate the fast pace of the project towards the end.

We usually had a simple agenda of topics to cover to ensure that we stayed on topic and completed the meetings as fast as possible, although they still
ended up being quite lengthy (up to 1 hour).


Group Coding:

Working on the same code with multiple people ended up being a smaller challenge than we expected. The hardest part was figuring out how to solve merge
conflicts with visual studio code. Each team member had their own branch that they would work on, while sometimes we mistakenly worked on master this never
happened to two people at the same time and so it never ended up being a problem (although we did try really hard to avoid it). Once somebody was done
with a session of coding, they would simply pull master, merge with master, and push. Since we all had different schedules and usually arranged to work
on different parts of the project concurrently, there were only a few serious merge conflicts - these conflicts happened during our group programming sessions
and could be solved with a quick conversation. Other than that, some minor conflicts happened that were quite clear to solve such as a really old function
being deleted because it was discussed to be redundant. We would also use telegram to let each other know when we were working on some specific functions,
this way, even when we were working in the same file, we'd avoid overwriting each other's functions.
