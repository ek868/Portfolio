# Eilia's Portfolio

Hi there, I am a **4th year computer science student at UNSW** who has completed most of the essential courses in his degree.
I am looking to begin my career as a software developer. Even though I am only at the beginning of my career, I have plenty of experience in creating software projects both in and out of university.

During my time as a programmer, I gained experience writing code in:
- C
- C#
- C++
- Java
- Python
- SQL
- **and more!**

I have also had plenty of experience with **object-oriented programming**, proper documentation and comments, exhaustive testing, *lots* of debugging, working in an agile development environment, and effectively working in **teams**.

You can find some of my older work in this repo, and a few links to some of my other repositories below. Have a browse!

## Recent Work

### Dungeon Game
This is an object-oriented java project - a pixelated action adventure game where that takes in level instructions and generates levels accordingly, allowing easy third party creation of levels. This repo is private due to the UNSW plagarism policy. Please send me a message on LinkedIn or contact me via email if you wish to view the code.

### Secret Calculator
This is an Android application written in Java that operates like a regular calculator with a secret feature. The application doubles as an encrypted file bank. Users can create encrypted folders and open/decrypt them later by entering in a specific sequence into the calculator.

This project is currently in development, view the git repo below to track progress and view the currently written code:
