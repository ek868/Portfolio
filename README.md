Hi there, I am a 4th year computer science student at UNSW who has completed most of the essential courses in his degree.
I am looking to begin my career as a software developer. Even though I am only at the beginning of my career, I have plenty of experience in creating software projects both in and out of university.

Below you can find a few of my projects and some links to some of my other repositories. Have a browse!
