# Mohammadmahdi Keyhanee Portfolio

Hi there, I am a **4th year computer science student at UNSW** who has completed most of the essential courses in his degree.
I am looking to begin my career as a software developer. Even though I am only at the beginning of my career, I have plenty of experience in creating software projects both in and out of university.

During my time as a programmer, I gained experience writing code in:
- C
- C#
- C++
- Java
- Python
- SQL
- **and more!**

I have also had plenty of experience with **object-oriented programming**, proper documentation and comments, exhaustive testing, *lots* of debugging, working in an agile development environment, and effectively working in **teams**.

You can find some of my older work in this repo, and a few links to some of my other repositories below. Have a browse!
