I do not recommend encrypting important files with this application... If you do, please make sure that the encrypted version of the file does not replace the original file.
This application was made before I had any disciplined training in software development and is in my portfolio just because viewers may find it interesting.

DECRYPTING A FILE WITH THE INCORRECT PASSWORD WILL DESTROY IT.

In most cases, the file will become irretreavable.
In the unlikely event that this actually happens to somebody, you can try to encrypt the destroyed file again with the same incorrect password that you used to destroy it.
This could reverse the file back to its original encrypted form, and then you can decrypt it again with the correct password.
