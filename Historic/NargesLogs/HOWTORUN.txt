Either install and run the server and then the client,

or run the server binary directly from "Build\NargesLogs_Server\NargesLogs_Server\bin\Debug"
and the client binary from "Build\NargesLogs\NargesLogs\bin\Debug"

Clients can access the server from outside networks. Forward port 3214 to the host machine and connect client to public ip address of host machine's network.
